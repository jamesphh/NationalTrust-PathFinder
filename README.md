This is not a particularly useful tool, rather just a project for myself to familiarise myself with front-end web development within python, as well as the Travelling Salesman Problem. 

Missing Features / todo:

  Allowing a user to delete their account.
  Thorough input validation and general error catching.
  Google Maps to show the route between the locations.
