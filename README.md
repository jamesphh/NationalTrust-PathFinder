a login system, storing the users username and encrypted password in an SQLite database;
JSON handling to retrieve infrormation about the various locations;
mathematical equations to find the great circle distance between locations from the coordinates;
an API to retrieve the users coordinates from the postcode they enter;
both a brute force and heuristic algorithm to find the shortest path between all locations, starting and ending at the users location.
